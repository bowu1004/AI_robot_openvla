# Try OpenVLA with a Realman Robot 

This project provides some basic examples of running OpenVLA with a Realman robot arm. 

# Getting Started

> Repository for OpenVLA https://github.com/openvla/openvla#fine-tuning-openvla-via-lora

This project currently includes an example code *run.py*, Realman robot can be driven to implement the specified task. There are some variables, including the prompt, that could be easily modified in this file. You are safe to edit them as you like to see how great OpenVLA works.

# Additional Notes

 - *robotic_arm_package* is the package to drive a Realman robot.
 - All packages required for OpenVLA are also needed to run this project.
 - In the example code, namely *run.py*, an Intel RealSence camera is used. The directory named *camera* includes the package for driving it. There is no need to install any additional packages for the camera if you  are using a Intel RealSence camera.
